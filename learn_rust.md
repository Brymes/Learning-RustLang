The fact that you are reading this article shows that you don't already know why
you should learn the Rust language, or that you know it, but are open to other 
reasons. Either way, it shows your interest in the language.

Rust is a beautiful language. It is not advisable for beginners in programming

## Rust: the language dissected
Rust was developed as a systems programming language by Mozilla. The first 
version of Rust (1.0) was released in 2015. Rust is praised as the replacement
of C and C++, or more recently as what a language would look like when created
by modern day engineers.

## Why you should learn Rust
The following are considerable reasons why you should learn Rust in 2022. Do 
well to check if one or more of the reasons suit your situations.
### 1. You have interest in systems programming
Like we have see in the previous section, Rust is a core systems programming
language.
### 2. You are into Blockchain engineering
Rust is a safe and memory efficient language. Asides that, it is an expressive
language that has a diverse stretch of crates or modules that support blockchain
development. 

Most programmers at the bleeding edge of Blockchain research code in Rust. 
Furthermore, a lot of tools built for the Blockchain ecosystem have their 
underlying logic in the Rust language.
