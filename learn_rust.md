## Introduction
The fact that you are reading this article shows that you don't already know why
you should learn the Rust language, or that you know it, but are open to other 
reasons. Either way, it shows your interest in the language.

Rust is a beautiful language. It is not advisable for beginners in programming 
to learn Rust due to its complexity and difference in syntax from other 
languages the beginner will possibly pick further on. Despite this, learning
Rust is worth the stress in 2022.

## Rust: the language dissected
Rust was developed as a systems programming language by Mozilla. The first 
version of Rust (1.0) was released in 2015. Rust is praised as the replacement
of C and C++, or more recently as what a language would look like when created
by modern day engineers.

## Why you should learn Rust
The following are considerable reasons why you should learn Rust in 2022. Do 
well to check if one or more of the reasons suit your situations.
### 1. You have interest in systems programming
Like we have see in the previous section, Rust is a core systems programming
language.
### 2. You are into Blockchain engineering
Rust is a safe and memory efficient language. Asides that, it is an expressive
language that has a diverse stretch of crates or modules that support blockchain
development. 

Most programmers at the bleeding edge of Blockchain research code in Rust. 
Furthermore, a lot of tools built for the Blockchain ecosystem have their 
underlying logic in the Rust language.

### 3. You are interested in embedded systems development
Initially, C and C++ remained irreplaceable in the embedded systems space. But as time went on
and programmers using other languages needed to move into embedded systems with their
already-familiar language, they started writing libraries in their native languages
to support embedded programming. Python, for example, has the tinyPython library, and Golang
has both gobot.io and tinyGo libraries.

It is only natural that the replacement language for C/C++ would support embedded systems 
development. As a result, there is the Embedded Rust library book that teaches how to program
microcontrollers of different kinds in Rust. There are also open-source libraries like the AVR-Dude library
for flashing Rust code to AVR microcontrollers.
